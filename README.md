# Configurations

As I always use almost same set of softwares and they require exactly same
configuration format, the same set of configurations should work on various
distributions.

# Goals

 - Provide consistent programmer experience across various distributions.
 - Should be reproducible, hard-coded configuration scripts.
 - Use suckless alternatives if possible.
